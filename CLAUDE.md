## Code Style

- Prefer minimal, targeted code changes. Avoid unnecessary refactoring or complex abstractions.
- Keep code clean and concise — no over-engineering.
- Bash scripts must be simple, concise, and easy to read. Avoid over-abstraction like loops over config arrays or excessive variables — prefer explicit, straightforward commands.
